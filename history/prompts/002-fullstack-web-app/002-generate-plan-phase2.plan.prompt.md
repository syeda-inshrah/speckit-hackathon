# Generate Phase 2 Implementation Plan: Multi-User Todo Web Application

## PROMPT_TEXT

Create a detailed implementation plan for the multi-user todo web application based on the specification. Include architecture overview, technology decisions with rationale, system design, security architecture, performance optimization strategies, deployment strategy, error handling, testing strategy, monitoring, scalability considerations, and architectural decision records.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created a comprehensive implementation plan document covering all architectural aspects of the multi-user todo web application. The plan includes detailed system architecture diagrams, technology decisions with trade-off analysis, database schema design, frontend architecture, security considerations, performance optimizations, deployment strategy, and risk analysis.

## OUTCOME

Successfully created the complete Phase 2 implementation plan that provides detailed architectural guidance for the development team. The plan addresses all technical requirements and includes risk mitigation strategies.

## EVALUATION

The implementation plan is thorough and well-structured, providing clear architectural guidance. It includes important considerations for security, performance, and scalability that will ensure a robust implementation.
