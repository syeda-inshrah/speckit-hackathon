# Create Phase 2 Specification: Multi-User Todo Web Application

## PROMPT_TEXT

Create a comprehensive specification for a multi-user todo web application following the hackathon requirements. The app should include user authentication, task management, and a modern UI. Include all necessary user stories, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and technical constraints.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created the complete specification document for the multi-user todo web application, covering all aspects from executive summary to appendices. The spec includes user stories for authentication, task management, and user experience, detailed functional requirements, non-functional requirements for performance and security, technical constraints, API contracts, data models, UI/UX specifications, acceptance criteria, and out-of-scope items.

## OUTCOME

Successfully created the complete Phase 2 specification document that covers all requirements from the hackathon documentation. The spec is comprehensive and follows the SDD approach.

## EVALUATION

The specification is complete and well-structured, covering all necessary aspects for Phase 2 implementation. It includes detailed user stories, functional requirements, technical constraints, and acceptance criteria that will guide the implementation phase.
