# Generate Phase 2 Implementation Tasks: Multi-User Todo Web Application

## PROMPT_TEXT

Break down the multi-user todo web application implementation into specific, testable tasks based on the specification and implementation plan. Create a detailed task list that covers backend development, frontend development, API implementation, authentication, database setup, testing, and deployment.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created a detailed task breakdown for the multi-user todo web application implementation. The tasks cover all aspects of development including backend API endpoints, authentication system, database models, frontend components, user interfaces, testing, and deployment procedures.

## OUTCOME

Successfully created the complete task breakdown for Phase 2 implementation. The tasks are granular enough to be assigned individually and include clear acceptance criteria.

## EVALUATION

The task breakdown is comprehensive and well-structured, providing clear guidance for implementation. Each task has clear acceptance criteria and can be developed independently while contributing to the overall feature.
