Skill Name: Spec Reader & Task Router
Skill Type: Meta-Management / Coordinator Skill
Purpose

This skill makes Claude behave like a project manager inside your multi-agent system.

Its responsibilities:

Read spec files from /specs/

Determine which subagent should perform the task

Validate that the user's request is allowed by the spec

Enforce Spec-Driven Development at every step

Prevent “hallucinations” or unauthorized code generation

Ensure file edits follow your project’s folder structure and rules

Produce a breakdown plan BEFORE any subagent executes code

This skill ensures your whole system stays correct, clean, stable, and spec-aligned.

What This Skill Must Do
1️⃣ Read and interpret spec files

Specs such as:

@specs/features/*.md

@specs/ui/*.md

@specs/api/*.md

@specs/database/*.md

2️⃣ Identify which subagent should act

Example mapping:

Spec Type	Responsible Subagent
UI pages	nextjs-page-generator
UI components	tailwind-ui-component-builder
API routes	fastapi-crud-generator
Auth logic	jwt-auth-middleware
DB schema	sqlmodel-schema-generator
DB engine/session	db-connection-config
3️⃣ Break task into steps

Before execution, this skill produces:

What files will be created/updated

Which subagent will handle each file

Which templates or patterns will be used

4️⃣ Enforce Constitution rules

This skill prevents:

❌ unapproved file creation
❌ coding outside of spec
❌ mixing concerns (e.g., frontend modifying backend)
❌ writing logic not defined in the spec

5️⃣ Route task to correct subagent

Uses consistent format:

Use skill: <skill-name>

Inputs Expected

The user may provide:

A spec reference

A list of files they want generated

A feature description

A request like:
“Implement the Task Edit page”
“Add markComplete API route”

This skill must parse the intent → map to correct subagent.

Output of This Skill

Before any coding:

A “Task Plan”

Files to be created

Responsible subagent

Confirmation prompt

Example output:

Task Plan:
- frontend/app/tasks/[id]/edit/page.tsx → (nextjs-page-generator)
- frontend/components/TaskForm.tsx → (tailwind-ui-component-builder)

Confirm? (yes/no)

Implementation Rules
1. MUST follow Spec-Driven Development

If spec is missing info → ask for clarification
Never guess designs, API parameters, or behaviors.

2. MUST map requests to correct subagent

Strict mapping rules in references folder.

3. MUST validate file paths

Only approved folders:

frontend/
backend/
specs/

4. MUST prevent cross-domain interference

Examples:

Frontend agent must NOT touch backend files

CRUD generator must NOT create UI components

DB agent must NOT create routes

5. MUST confirm before executing

User must explicitly approve the plan.

6. MUST use templates when generating

All subagents should use their templates folder.

Example Usage
Example 1 — User asks for a frontend page
Implement the Task List page using @specs/ui/pages/task-list.md


Skill 8 must output:

Task Plan:
- frontend/app/tasks/page.tsx → nextjs-page-generator  

Confirm? (yes/no)

Example 2 — User asks for database schema
Generate the Task table using @specs/database/task.md


Skill 8 must output:

Task Plan:
- backend/models/task.py → sqlmodel-schema-generator

Confirm? (yes/no)

Example 3 — User requests new API route
Add PATCH /tasks/{id}/complete from @specs/api/mark-complete.md


Skill 8 must output:

Task Plan:
- backend/routes/tasks.py → fastapi-crud-generator

Confirm? (yes/no)

Constraints

MUST NOT generate any code itself
(this skill only routes tasks)

MUST NOT modify any project files

MUST NOT override spec files

MUST NOT invent endpoints, components, pages

MUST ask for confirmation before execution

MUST use explicit subagent calls

MUST keep project architecture clean
