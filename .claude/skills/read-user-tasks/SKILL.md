# Skill Name: ReadUserTasks

## Purpose

This skill is responsible for reading and retrieving a user’s todo tasks in response
to natural language chat requests.

It enables the AI chatbot to answer questions like:
- “What are my tasks?”
- “What do I need to do today?”
- “Show my pending todos”
- “What have I completed?”

This skill is strictly READ-ONLY.

## What This Skill Must Do

- Fetch tasks belonging to the authenticated user
- Support common filters:
  - status (pending, completed)
  - due date (today, upcoming)
  - priority (if supported)
- Convert chat intent into structured read queries
- Return structured task data for other agents to consume

---

## What This Skill Must NOT Do

- ❌ Create tasks
- ❌ Update tasks
- ❌ Delete tasks
- ❌ Modify database state
- ❌ Generate conversational responses

All write operations belong to **ModifyUserTasks**.
